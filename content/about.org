Hi! Welcome to my personal website and blog. I'm Daryl Galvez, an aspiring IT professional. I have previously worked as a marine engineer and now,
I am exploring my passion in technology and I hope that I'm able to work in the industry in the future.

I will be using this website as a professional site as well as a practice for my writing (Apologies in advance for the amateur writing style.) My
focus here will be mainly about technology, Free, Libre, and Open Source Software, and anything under the sun.

In the future, I would like to write better and cover deeper topics.

I hope you will find value in this website. Reach out to me and tell me what you think :)


Stay safe.
