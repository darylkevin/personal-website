Hi! I'm Daryl Galvez and this is my personal website/blog. I'm a marine engineer by profession and I am an aspiring IT professional.
I am fairly new to the industry and am still learning the ropes, but in "millenial" years, considered relatively "old". :p

I do hope that I can contribute what I learned from my time being a marine engineer to the tech industry.
