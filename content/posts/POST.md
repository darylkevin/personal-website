As some of you might have known, I just passed my CompTIA A+ certification exam. That exam basically says that I am competent in a variety of IT troubleshooting and help desk skills for both software and hardware. Just a few days after obtaining that certification, my skills were immediately tested in real life.

## What's the problem?

My girlfriend actually is a dentist and she has this really expensive X ray machine called a CBCT. I got a message from her telling me that they have a problem with their CBCT. It is connected to a PC workstation where all the scans from that CBCT is fed, read, and printed. She told me that the workstation cannot start. They really need that workstation up and running, otherwise her clinic won't be able to service patients' needs and will set them back thousands pesos everyday that the workstation stays down. (insert video link)

## Diagnosis

I went to the clinic in the morning and tried to boot up the workstation. The fans start indicating that power is being supplied to the workstation. After a while, the fans stop spinning and the PC fails to boot. This looks like a symptom of failure to POST.

## What is POST?

POST (Power On Self Test) is a set of procedures performed by software or firmware that a device runs through immediately each time it is turned on. This is a part of the device's pre-boot sequence. If it is successful, the device then loads the operating system, otherwise the device will fail to boot.
