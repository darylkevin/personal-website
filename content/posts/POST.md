As some of you might have known, I just passed my CompTIA A+ certification exam. That exam basically says that I am competent in a variety of IT troubleshooting and help desk skills for both software and hardware. Just a few days after obtaining that certification, my skills were immediately tested in real life.

## What happened?

I got a message from my girlfriend telling me that they have a problem in their clinic. My girlfriend actually is a dentist and she has this really expensive Xray machine called a CBCT. It is connected to a PC workstation where all the scans from that CBCT is fed, read, and printed. She told me that that workstation cannot start. (insert video link)
