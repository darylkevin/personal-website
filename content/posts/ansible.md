Let's dive into the basics of setting up your workstation environment (whether it is a laptop or a desktop) using a free and open source tool called Ansible.

## What is Ansible?

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is a free and open-source configuration management and software automation project developed by [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en). It is mostly used in production environments such as in servers for setting them up.

## Why learn Ansible?

Ansible is a powerful tool despite it being easy to use. It can automate most of the tasks that we usually do when we start out with a new system. Most of us apply a few 'tweaks' to our systems to suit our tastes, be it setting up a wallpaper, applying icon themes, or installing and uninstalling programs.

Sometimes, this can take some time and this is where Ansible comes in.
