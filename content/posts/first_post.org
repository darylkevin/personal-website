*** Hello World!~

Hello! My name is Daryl (in case you did not catch that on the main pane haha).
This is my first attempt at building my own website. Well... I did not build it
from /scratch/ myself. I used a static site generator called [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]].

I plan to use this site as a personal blog to write down my thoughts. I may also
post articles that I find interesting from time to time.

I hope that you will find value in this site as more content is added here.



*Stay safe out there!*
