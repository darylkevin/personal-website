** Creating a static website using Hugo
In this post, I would like to talk about Hugo and detail how I managed to create this website.

*** What is Hugo?
According to their [[https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/][About Page]], Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in
the Go programming language. To put it simply, Hugo helps you build the frame work for your
website without getting your hands dirty with coding. You can focus on creating your content
and then Hugo does the rest.

Of course, Hugo still provides you the freedom to code and tweak your website if that's what you
want. Hugo just makes it easier for you to do so.

You can read more about the benefits of using Hugo or any other static site generator [[https://gohugo.io/about/benefits/][here]].
